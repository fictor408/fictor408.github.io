	Hello and welcome to my page. I am glad you decided to look a little deeper than just my home page. Now to give a very (im)proper introduction of myself.
</p>
<p>
Currently I reside in the garlic capitol of the world, Gilroy, California and yes, I love garlic. I have lived here my whole life and do not regret a single second of it. I went to Gavilan Community College where I graciously graduated with my AA in Liberal Arts (CSIS) in a world record of 5 years.  Currently I am a student in my junior year at CSU Monterey Bay studying Communication Design with a concentration in video game design. I might have also acquire a minor in  Chicanx Studies or Hispanic Cultures & History. 
</p>
<p>	
As you might be able to see, my passion is video games and animals. My biggest childhood memories are staying out of the sun playing Legend of Zelda on the Nintendo 64 and Super Mario World on the SNES. Runescape also holds a major place in my heart, due  to the years I spent playing it. I remember being on the house phone, the original party chat, with my cousin playing from 7AM till Midnight. 
</p>
<p>
I have a pup by the name of Kiara (Birthday October 9th 2018) and two cats named Neo and Ashley.

<p>Now I have not been alone through this road we travel called "life". For over the past 7 years, I have been lucky to have this beautiful soul by my side. Most people have a difficult time following their dreams with a positive support system but I spent all my luck finding her. Her name is Lily and we have been together since February 3rd, 2012. We met in high school, well actually through Facebook but thats another story. Even though I can be be a big Nerd and rather spend money on video games instead of myself, she is always supportive. She even let me wear a Legend of Zelda ugly Christmas sweater for our holiday picture. </p>
